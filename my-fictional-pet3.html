  <h1>CHIMERA...(Greece)</h1>

  <p><strong><em>The great greek Chimera</em></strong></p>

  <body>
    <p>In Greek mythology, the chimera is a three-headed, fire-breathing hybrid monster with the head and body of a lion, the head of a goat on its back and a tail that ends with a head of a snake. The legendary beast is the child of Typhoeus, the mightiest and deadliest monster, and Echidna, a half-snake, half-woman creature. Ancient Greek and Roman art have often shown this beast being slain by the hero Bellerophon while riding the winged horse Pegasus.</p>

    <p>The term "chimera" has come to describe any mythical or fictional creature with parts taken from various animals, to describe anything composed of very disparate parts, or perceived as wildly imaginative, implausible, or dazzling.</p>

    <p>The Chimera is generally considered to have been female (see the quotation from Hesiod above) despite the mane adorning her head, the inclusion of a close mane was often depicted on lionesses, but the ears were always visible (that does not occur with depictions of male lions).</p>
    <p>While there are different genealogies, in one version the Chimera mated with her brother Orthrus and was the mother of the Sphinx and the Nemean lion (others have Orthrus and their mother, Echidna, mating; most attribute all to Typhon and Echidna).</p>

    <p>The Chimera finally was defeated by Bellerophon with the help of Pegasus, at the command of King Iobates of Lycia, after terrorizing Lycia and nearby lands. Since Pegasus could fly, Bellerophon shot the Chimera from the air, safe from her heads and breath.[9] A scholiast to Homer adds that he finished her off by equipping his spear with a lump of lead that melted when exposed to the Chimera's fiery breath and consequently killed her..</p>

    <p>From its brief above,the chimera can be a scary pet to have..but its still qualifies to be one of the most feared mythodological creatures ever lived....!</p>
